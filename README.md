## Software-Testing
This repository is a hub of various testing techniques. So far, you can find two sub repositories in it namely-
 1. Unit test cases: This repository has been used for [an article](https://swatirajwal.medium.com/unit-testing-of-simple-java-programs-b785a164b440). This article is intended for any individual who is simply beginning with unit testing in java. Here, I have written three very simple java programs and their corresponding test cases to help you understand the concept. The article will cover everything from installing necessary packages.
 2. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA): This repository covers a very popular and fundamental concept of software testing, i.e., Boundary Value Analysis using Boundary value checking. To understand how to use this repository and other related information, kindly follow [this](https://swatirajwal.medium.com/software-testing-boundary-value-analysis-using-boundary-value-checking-58febd474188) tutorial.
