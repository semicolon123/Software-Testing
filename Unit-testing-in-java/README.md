# Unit Test Cases for Simple Java Programs

This repository is part of an article which is intended for any individual who is simply beginning with unit testing in java. Here, I have written three very simple java programs and their corresponding test cases to help you understand the concept. The article will cover everything from installing necessary packages to running your very first unit test case for a Java program.

Please go to [this article](https://swatirajwal.medium.com/unit-testing-of-simple-java-programs-b785a164b440) to find more details. In case of any query, kindly comment. I will be happy to answer.
