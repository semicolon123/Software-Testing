# Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) 

It is a technique employed for black-box testing (also called Dynamic Testing). As a software tester, you always want to maximize the probability of finding errors. The test cases designed with boundary input values have high chances to find errors. This is how BVA can be a good choice to test software.
